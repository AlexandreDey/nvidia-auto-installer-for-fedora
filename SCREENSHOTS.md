#### There are tons of more new addition with this update
They could not be listed here with their screenshots as there are too many of them. Feel free to check the releases and try them out.

### v0.2.6
This was a bugfix update targetted to take down a critical bug that prevented users to add the RPM Fusion repository for proprietary NVIDIA drivers. This does not look very different from v0.2.5, hence no screenshot was added for it.

### v0.2.5
